-- Some queries that we're supposed to do for practice...

-- TASK 1
SELECT * FROM film
WHERE replacement_cost BETWEEN 12.99 AND 16.99;

-- TASK 2
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM actor
WHERE last_name IN ('Penelope', 'Nick', 'Ed);

-- TASK 3
SELECT * FROM film
WHERE rental_rate IN (0.99, 2.99, 4.99) AND replacement_cost IN (12.99, 15.99, 28.99);


-- End of homework
